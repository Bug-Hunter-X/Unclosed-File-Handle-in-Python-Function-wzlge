This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked bug in Python: unclosed file handles. The bug.py file contains a function that opens a file but forgets to close it. This can lead to resource leaks, especially with many files opened simultaneously.  The bugSolution.py file shows how to correctly close the file using the 'with' statement, which is preferred for its exception handling. Always remember to close files after you are done with them. This is crucial for responsible resource management.
